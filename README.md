# News Article Widget Written in Pure Javascript Modules
A simple widget written in pure modular javascript, no jquery no other library or framework or templating engine 

# Requirements:

Fetch the data and render it on the page. Initially the page should show only a list of titles fetched from the source. On clicking the title it should show the relevant image and content of the article associated with the title as well as related stories, if available. There should be a “read more” link to the article source. Above the list of articles there should be a search field for filtering the articles. Upon typing either the title or a keyword from the article content the list should be filtered to show only relevant results from an already rendered content. The filtering should occur as the user is typing. Additionally the user should be able to filter by date published.

# Restrictions:

You are not allowed to use jQuery or any other libraries, including helper libraries such as templating ones. Instead, use core Javascript features.
You can use either ECMAScript5 or ECMAScript6 (ES2015) features.
Code should be clean, modular and reusable.

Implementing UX features based on the time it takes to load the data. (Think GMAIL).
Showcasing your CSS/SCSS skills by not using Bootstrap or similar libraries.
Making it app mobile friendly.
Making the application flexible, e.g. implementing options for number of items shown, options for showing or hiding related news etc.
Making code testable
